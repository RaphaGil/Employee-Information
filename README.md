# Employee-Information

## Overview

I'm currently undertaking the 9th challenge in my Front-End Developer bootcamp. The task involves transforming given starter code into a functional Node.js command-line application. This application will gather information about employees on a software engineering team and generate an HTML webpage displaying summaries for each person. Comprehensive tests have been provided to ensure all aspects of the code pass successfully.

## Description

In my role as a manager, I find it imperative to have a reliable tool that simplifies the process of presenting my team's fundamental information. This tool serves the purpose of generating a user-friendly webpage that showcases key details such as email addresses and GitHub profiles for each team member. To achieve this, my application seamlessly integrates Jest for executing unit tests and leverages Inquirer for seamlessly collecting user inputs from the command line interface. To initiate the application, users simply need to execute the following command:

Copy code: node index.js

This command triggers the application, empowering managers like myself to effortlessly access and manage crucial team information.
